This is an archive of all the led-related projects I've done so far.

I've come back to it quite a few times so it's pretty messy!

# Summary

## /2022-tree-effects
How it all started! Matt Parker made a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuMRJf6B5Q4&ab_channel=Stand-upMaths) about an LED Christmas tree, which inspired me to make a simulation and some of my own effects.

## /2023-lights
In 2023, I decided to try this out myself. Through Monash Automation, a student team, I setup my own tree and scanned it.

## /2024-pi-setup-backup
In 2024, I decided to rewrite this all into a configurable OOP Python package, [dynamic_leds](https://github.com/jmang00/dynamic_leds).


This is a backup of the setup on a raspberry pi in the Monash Automation lab in 2024, *using* this library. It has **scenes** and a command line interface.


## Future
* Combine into one repository and write out setup instructions.
* Package into an installable tool
* Put the dynamic_leds module on `PyPI`
